**Good to know:**
At 42, all C projects must follow a very strict coding standard called "The Norm". It enforces consistency, modularity and readability through several rules.
For example:

- functions must not exceed 25 lines  
- no ternary operators  
- no for loops  
- no switch statements  
- and several other stylistic constraints

Because of this, my 42 project code may look minimalistic or follow a specific structure. It simply adheres to "The Norm".

The Python projects use flake8 for linting and are written in compliance with its style guidelines.
